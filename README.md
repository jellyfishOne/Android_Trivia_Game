# Android_Trivia_Game
A trivia game about cats for android!

This is my first android application (yay!). I developed the app using android studio with API 15. and tested the app on a Samsung galaxy s3.

I developed this application as a way to practice new android developing concepts I’m learning. The app is a simple 10 questions trivia game (all about cats). At the end, it displays your score.

In future updates, I hope to add username support, saving the user’s top 3 scores to a database, adding more questions, and adding pictures and sounds to make the app more interactive and engaging for the user.
